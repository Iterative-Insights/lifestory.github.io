        <p>Dear Visitor,</p>
        <p>
            My Dad's passing brought on stories from my Aunts and Uncles, 
            about how they played and lived when they were young - 
            hiding from typhoons, playing with cicadas, 
            grandma's passion for mahjong. 
            Dad and his siblings would pick food from dishes first, 
            and eat rice in their bowl last because there were 7 kids 
            and not enough to eat. 
            Dad rarely talked about his life, 
            and I think this is common for many families.
        </p>
        <p>
            LifeStory is an app about remembrance and introspection. 
            Older generations can share stories and hear greetings from the young.  
            Younger generations can receive advice from their elders. 
            Friends can recount and capture memorable moments.  
            A living family knowledgebase, 
            with the goal of maintaining bonds across the generations. 
            Typical families have 3 generations of memory, 
            and this is a sliding window, always progressing. 
            This platform will strive to be something meaningful, 
            that can help families and friends maintain a lasting archive for the future. 
            Those interested in more details can email me below.
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
